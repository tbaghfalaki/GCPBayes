# Descripsion 
Execute a Gibbs sampler to analyze a multivariate Bayesian sparse group selection model, employing Dirac, continuous, and hierarchical spike priors to detect pleiotropic effects on two traits. This package is specifically designed for summary statistics comprising estimated regression coefficients and their corresponding covariance matrix.

### Installation
To acquire the latest development version of GCPBayes, you may utilize the following code snippet to install it directly from GitHub:

```
  # install.packages("devtools")
  devtools::install_github("tbaghfalaki/GCPBayes")
```
This will seamlessly fetch and install the most up-to-date version of GCPBayes for your use.

The package is now accessible on R CRAN as well![https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GCPBayes/index.html]
```
  install.packages("GCPBayes")
```
